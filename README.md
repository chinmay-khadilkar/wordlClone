# wordlClone
Wordl clone is a simple js html and css exercise
wordl involves the clicking indivdual key on the rendered key board and showing the values inside the boxes.
this means wordl involves individually targating the dom elements rendering content in them and lots of events.
to handle such cases for now the best option is to simple use DOM.
This is the first complete project draft it will be revised as the time progresses.


To check this simply pick up html css and javascript files and keep them in onr flder and open the html in a browser.
